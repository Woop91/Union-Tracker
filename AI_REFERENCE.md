## 🏗️ PROJECT OVERVIEW

**What:** Google Apps Script application for union steward grievance tracking, member management, and reporting.
**Repo:** `Woop91/DDS-Dashboard` (private). Default branch: `Main` (capital M).
**Mirror:** `Woop91/Union-Tracker-` (public). See SYNC-LOG.md for exclusion rules.
**Deployed via:** CLASP (`clasp push`) to Google Apps Script, bound to a Google Sheet.
**Target users:** Union stewards (power users) and members (casual users) at MassAbility DDS (SEIU 509).
**Architecture:** 39 source `.gs` files + 8 `.html` files in `src/` → copied individually to `dist/` via `node build.js`.
**Current build:** 39 `.gs` + 8 `.html` files in `dist/` (individual file mode, NOT consolidated).
**Web App:** Served via `doGet()` using inline HTML (`HtmlService.createHtmlOutput()`). Does NOT use `createTemplateFromFile()`.
**DDS Apps Script ID:** `18hHHX-4E_ykGCqu_EDwKCwqY9ycyRgPtOmguacsxnVZ4YsRh-YETODiu`
**UT Apps Script ID:** `1V6vzrczxUSYuiobdkKE64mbsZYznZHZwcI51juAtqQojy5Tz8q5zbiTl`

### ⚠️ Key Reminders
- **Critical rules** (dynamic-only, 1-indexed columns, escapeHtml, etc.) → **See CLAUDE.md**
- **Sync rules & WT exclusions** → **See SYNC-LOG.md**
- **`dist/` files are auto-generated.** Never edit directly. Edit `src/*.gs` files, then run `npm run build`.
- **`dist/ConsolidatedDashboard.gs` is DELETED** as of v4.13.0. Build now copies individual files.
- **`web-dashboard/` folder is LEGACY/ORPHANED.** Do not deploy or integrate it.
- **CLASP rootDir:** `./dist` — only `dist/` contents go to Apps Script.
- **Deploy:** `npm run deploy` (lint + test + build:prod + clasp push). Must run locally (requires Google OAuth).
- **After any merge to Main:** Remind user to run `npm run deploy`. Agent cannot run clasp remotely.

## 📁 ARCHITECTURE MAP

### Build Pipeline
```
src/*.gs (39 files) + src/*.html (8 files)
    → build.js (copy-files mode) → dist/*.gs + dist/*.html (individual files)
                                    dist/appsscript.json (manifest)
    → clasp push → Google Apps Script project
```
**Note:** As of v4.13.0, `dist/ConsolidatedDashboard.gs` is deleted. Build copies individual files to `dist/`. GAS needs separate `.html` files for `createTemplateFromFile()` and `createHtmlOutputFromFile()`.

### Source File Load Order
| Prefix | Layer | Key Files |
|--------|-------|-----------|
| `00_` | Foundation | `DataAccess.gs`, `Security.gs` |
| `01_` | Core | `Core.gs` — constants, config, utilities |
| `02_` | Data | `DataManagers.gs` — CRUD operations |
| `03_` | UI | `UIComponents.gs` — menus, dialogs |
| `04a-e` | UI modules | Menus, accessibility, interactive/executive/public dashboards |
| `05_` | Integrations | Drive, Calendar, Email, Web App API functions |
| `06_` | Maintenance | Admin tools, undo/redo, audit |
| `07_` | DevTools | Dev-only utilities (**excluded in prod build**) |
| `08a-d` | Sheet utils | Setup, search, forms, audit formulas |
| `09_` | Dashboards | Dashboard rendering |
| `10_-10d` | Business logic | Main entry, sheet creation, forms, sync |
| `11_-17_` | Features | CommandHub, self-service, meetings, events, correlation |
| `18_` | Workload Tracker | **DDS ONLY** — excluded from Union-Tracker |
| `19_-24_` | Web Dashboard SPA | Auth, config reader, data service, app entry, portal sheets, weekly questions |
| `25_` | Workload Service | SPA-integrated workload tracking (SSO auth, separate from standalone WT portal) |

### HTML Files in src/
| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `index.html` | SPA entry point (unified dashboard) |
| `steward_view.html` | Steward command center |
| `member_view.html` | Member dashboard |
| `auth_view.html` | Login/auth page |
| `error_view.html` | Error display |
| `styles.html` | Shared CSS |
| `MultiSelectDialog.html` | Multi-select dropdown UI |
| `WorkloadTracker.html` | WT portal (**DDS only**) |

### Web App Routing (doGet)
```
doGet(e)
├── Default → SPA (doGetWebDashboard) with SSO/magic link auth
├── ?mode=steward  → Steward Command Center (requires auth, shows PII)
├── ?mode=member   → Member Dashboard (no PII)
├── ?page=search   → Search (requires steward auth)
├── ?page=grievances → Grievance list (requires steward auth)
├── ?page=members  → Member list (requires steward auth)
├── ?page=links    → Links page
├── ?page=selfservice → Member self-service (Google auth or PIN)
├── ?page=portal   → Public portal
├── ?page=workload → Workload tracker (DDS only)
├── ?page=checkin  → Meeting check-in (v4.11.0)
├── ?page=resources → SPA with resources tab pre-selected (v4.11.0)
├── ?page=notifications → SPA with notifications tab pre-selected (v4.12.0)
└── Deep-link: ?page=X → SPA reads PAGE_DATA.initialTab → _handleTabNav()
```

### Authentication System
- **Steward access:** Google account email matched against authorized list via `checkWebAppAuthorization('steward')`
- **Member access:** Google account email OR PIN-based login
- **SPA auth:** Google SSO + magic link (19_WebDashAuth.gs)
- **Dashboard auth toggle:** `isDashboardMemberAuthRequired()` — when enabled, all dashboard pages require member login
- **Auth config:** `ScriptProperties` (no manual setup required — `initWebDashboardAuth()` handles first-time)

### HTML Serving Method
As of v4.13.0, the build outputs individual `.html` files to `dist/`, enabling both `HtmlService.createHtmlOutput()` (inline strings) and `createTemplateFromFile()`/`createHtmlOutputFromFile()` (file-based). The SPA modules (19-25) use file-based HTML. Legacy modules (04-13) still use inline HTML strings.

## 📊 SHEET STRUCTURE

### Member Directory (31 columns)
- Headers read dynamically via `MEMBER_HEADER_MAP_` → `MEMBER_COLS`
- Key columns: Email, Role, Name, Unit, Phone, Is Steward

### Grievance Log (28 columns)
- Headers read dynamically via `GRIEVANCE_HEADER_MAP_` → `GRIEVANCE_COLS`
- Key columns: Grievance ID, Member Email, Status, Current Step, Deadline, Assigned Steward

### Config Tab
- Single source of truth for org-specific settings
- Columns built via `CONFIG_HEADER_MAP_` → `CONFIG_COLS`
- Row 1 = section headers, Row 2 = column headers, Data starts at row 3
- **See CLAUDE.md for detailed write-path rules**

### Resources Sheet (12 columns, v4.11.0)
- Headers via `RESOURCES_HEADER_MAP_` → `RESOURCES_COLS`
- Auto-creates with 8 starter articles on first access

### Notifications Sheet (12 columns, v4.12.0)
```
Notification ID | Recipient | Type | Title | Message | Priority
Sent By | Sent By Name | Created Date | Expires Date | Dismissed By | Status
```
- Auto-ID: NOTIF-XXX
- Types: Steward Message, Announcement, Deadline, System
- Priority: Normal, Urgent
- Dismissed_By: comma-separated emails (per-member tracking)
- Active until: Expires Date passes, member dismisses, or steward archives

### Hidden Sheets (v4.12.2)
- `_Weekly_Questions` — weekly engagement questions
- `_Contact_Log` — steward-member interaction log (8 columns)
- `_Steward_Tasks` — steward task management (10 columns)

### Architectural Rule: No Formulas in Visible Sheets
All visible sheets (Dashboard, Member Satisfaction, Feedback) contain only VALUES, never formulas. Data is recomputed by JavaScript on each change. No broken formula references, no circular dependencies, no formula chains.

## 🔑 DESIGN DECISIONS LOG

Records **why** architectural choices were made, so future LLMs don't undo them.

| Date | Decision | Reasoning |
|------|----------|-----------|
| 2026-02-24 | Resources page uses Fraunces serif font | Conveys authority/trust — it's a union tool, not a SaaS product |
| 2026-02-24 | Navy + earth tones (#1e3a5f, #fafaf9) | Avoid generic AI purple gradients |
| 2026-02-24 | Check-in page uses green theme | Differentiate from other pages visually |
| 2026-02-24 | Notifications in separate sheet (not Member Directory column) | Notifications are ephemeral; don't pollute member data |
| 2026-02-24 | Dismissed_By as comma-separated in single cell | Avoids per-member rows, scales to thousands |
| 2026-02-24 | Notification auto-ID scans existing IDs for max number | Gap-safe even if rows deleted |
| 2026-02-25 | ConfigReader reads column-based Config (not row-based key-value) | Aligns with existing CONFIG_COLS system; old reader was incompatible |
| 2026-02-25 | Default accent hue changed from 250 (blue) → 30 (amber) | Warm palette matches union identity, distinguishes from generic dashboards |
| 2026-02-25 | SPA deep-links (?page=X → initialTab) with standalone HTML fallback | Consistent SPA experience, but graceful degradation if SPA unavailable |
| 2026-02-25 | `initWebDashboardAuth()` auto-configures on first run | No manual ScriptProperties setup required — reduces deployment friction |
| 2026-02-25 | Switched from consolidated single-file build to individual-file build | GAS needs separate `.html` files for `createTemplateFromFile()` and `createHtmlOutputFromFile()`. Individual files also easier to debug in GAS editor. |
| 2026-02-25 | Added `25_WorkloadService.gs` alongside `18_WorkloadTracker.gs` | 25_ is SPA-integrated (SSO auth), 18_ is standalone portal (PIN auth). Different auth models = separate modules. |

## 📝 NOTES FOR FUTURE LLMs

1. **Read CLAUDE.md first** — it has the most critical rules including column constant patterns, config write paths, and security patterns.
2. **Read this file second** — it has architecture context, error history, and protected code.
3. **Read SYNC-LOG.md if touching UT** — full exclusion registry with line numbers.
4. **The `web-dashboard/` folder is dead code.** Do not deploy or integrate it.
5. **Never edit `dist/` files directly.** Edit `src/*.gs` and run `npm run build` (copies individual files to dist).
6. **Test with `npm run ci`** before pushing.
7. **Deploy with `npm run deploy`** (lint + test + prod build + clasp push).
8. **Build is 39 `.gs` + 8 `.html` individual files in `dist/`.** GAS has a 6MB per-file limit. Monitor individual file sizes.
9. **The `doGet()` source is in `src/05_Integrations.gs`** (routes) and `src/22_WebDashApp.gs` (SPA entry).
10. **Do not duplicate information across reference docs.** Each doc has one canonical purpose (see table at top).

## 2026-02-28 — Branch Cleanup & Version Alignment (v4.18.1)

### Actions Taken
- **Deleted stale branches:** `dev` (1 behind Main, 0 ahead), `staging` (1 behind Main, 0 ahead). No unique content lost.
- **Version alignment:** `package.json` updated from 4.10.0 → 4.18.1 to match `VERSION_INFO` in `01_Core.gs`.
- **CLAUDE.md updated:** Replaced multi-branch workflow with single-branch `Main` policy. Added mandatory version tagging, parity enforcement, and no-assumptions policy.
- **Sync flow simplified:** `DDS Main → UT Main` (direct, no intermediate staging).

### Errors Found & Fixed
- **package.json drift:** Was stuck at 4.10.0 while code was at 4.18.1. Root cause: version bump in `01_Core.gs` and `CHANGELOG.md` but `package.json` was never updated after v4.10.0. Fixed by updating to 4.18.1.
- **Branch accumulation:** `dev` and `staging` branches existed on remote but were just behind `Main` with no unique content. Deleted to enforce single-branch policy.

### Version History
- v4.18.1 — Current. Branch cleanup, version alignment, CLAUDE.md overhaul.

### Reminders for LLMs
- **Everything must be dynamic.** Never hardcode sheet names, column positions, org names, unit names, or config values.
- **Single branch: Main only.** Never create dev/staging/feature branches.
- **Version bump is mandatory** on every code change: `VERSION_INFO` + `package.json` + `CHANGELOG.md` + git tag.
- **DDS Script ID must NEVER appear in Union-Tracker** (public repo).
- **Read before act.** Never assume repo state, file contents, or function behavior.

## 2026-02-28 — Workflow Correction (v4.18.2)

### Error Found & Corrected
- **Previous action (v4.18.1) incorrectly deleted UT staging and dev branches.** The user's intended workflow requires UT `staging` as the Claude-managed sync target, with `dev` and `Main` being user-managed. UT staging and dev branches were recreated from current Main (in full parity).
- **Root cause:** Claude assumed "ALL REPOS IN PARITY" meant single-branch everywhere. User clarification revealed the correct flow: `DDS Main → UT staging → [user] → UT dev → UT Main`.

### Actions Taken
- Recreated UT `staging` and `dev` branches (both starting from current Main = v4.18.1, so in parity)
- Updated CLAUDE.md in both repos with correct sync flow diagram
- Added Code Review rules: no false "FIXED" claims, full codebase pattern search, no inflated scores
- Clarified: DDS = single branch (Main only), UT = 3 branches (staging=Claude, dev/Main=user)
- Added fallback handoff protocol: timestamped notes for follow-on agents

## 2026-02-28 — Final Branch Simplification

### Actions Taken
- Deleted UT `staging` and `dev` branches (confirmed Main was not behind either — 0 behind staging, 1 ahead of dev)
- Reverted sync flow to direct: `DDS Main → UT Main`
- Updated CLAUDE.md in both repos to reflect single-branch policy on both repos
